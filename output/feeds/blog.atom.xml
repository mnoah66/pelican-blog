I realized that the Wordpress's and SquareSpace's that are out there were a little too modern, with some of their themes being a bit much.  I wanted something easy, but also something perhaps challenging that would help me learn a bit about the finer details of programming and web development.  Already in love with the Python programming language, I landed on &lt;a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/generating-static-websites-pelican-jinja2-markdown.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this Pelican Tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fullstackpython.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed that tutorial until the end and had to do a bit more digging on how to deploy to S3, including how to use with CloudFlare's SSL services.  Static sites like this one do not necessarily need HTTPS, but it's becoming &lt;em&gt;de rigure&lt;/em&gt; so I wanted to implement it anyway.  After some more extensive Googling (S3 + Pelican + CloudFlare) and a quick CloudFlare support ticket, I finally had it up and running.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="pelican"></category></entry><entry><title>Windows for Development</title><link href="/windows-for-development.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Martin Noah</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-05-06:/windows-for-development.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am a Windows user and I am not alone.

Surprisingly, and yet not, as most tools and development environments &lt;strong&gt;heavily&lt;/strong&gt; favor UNIX based systems yet most are using Windows.  Sure, Windows users have plenty of tools at their disposal, including the Linux sub-system in Windows 10, virtual computing a la Oracle's VirtualBox, and of course the growing world of web-based IDE's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So what, then, is the point?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In developing this blog and in learning the Python ecosystem, I have jumped through too many hoops to get to the same finish line.  From &lt;em&gt;VNC'ing&lt;/em&gt; into a Raspberry Pi, to installing Ubuntu on an older laptop, to WSL on my current Windows 10 setup, to Mint on Virtualbox.  Each track requiring a refresher on the peculiarities of each down to the simplest command of &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;dir.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="windows"></category></entry></feed>
