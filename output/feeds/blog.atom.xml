I realized that the Wordpress's and SquareSpace's that are out there were a little too modern, with some of their themes being a bit much.  I wanted something easy, but also something perhaps challenging that would help me learn a bit about the finer details of programming and web development.  Already in love with the Python programming language, I landed on &lt;a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/generating-static-websites-pelican-jinja2-markdown.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this Pelican Tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fullstackpython.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed that tutorial until the end and had to do a bit more digging on how to deploy to S3, including how to use with CloudFlare's SSL services.  Static sites like this one do not necessarily need HTTPS, but it's becoming &lt;em&gt;de rigure&lt;/em&gt; so I wanted to implement it anyway.  After some more extensive Googling (S3 + Pelican + CloudFlare) and a quick CloudFlare support ticket, I finally had it up and running.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="pelican"></category></entry></feed>
