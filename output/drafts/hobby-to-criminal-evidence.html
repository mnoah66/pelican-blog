                <p>We moved into our first home in May 2017 and by September we were victims of an attempted burglary.  We were one of the lucky ones that day as neighbors homes were actually broken into and items stolen, including a diamond engagement ring. But this isn't about luck or justice, this is about the Raspberry Pi's ubiquity, and the important line between a hobby/pet-project and </p>
<p>It was late September 2017 and I am at my office, click-clacking away on some spreadsheet.  My wife calls, emotional and distraught, with the news that our neighbors home had been broken in to.  Items were stolen, and police were in the neighborhood checking nearby homes and speaking with residents.  Our home looked fine and there were no signs of intrusion or disturbance. So aside from the initial shock-and-awe we carried on about our day.  I finished up my work and headed to the dentist to get stitches removed from a recent extraction (fun!).</p>
<p>As I'm driving the thought of checking the Pi's surveillance photos (just for the heck of it, at this point) flushes my body.  I pull over and open the Dropbox app on my phone.  I navigate to the photos from earlier on that day and see the usual photos of our lab, Athena,  having set off the motion detection logic of my Raspberry Pi's home surveillaince/motion detection program inspired by <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/01/home-surveillance-and-motion-detection-with-the-raspberry-pi-python-and-opencv/">this</a>.  The only thing glaringly odd is her tail sticking straight out/up, indicating that she is on high alert and defensive. Clicking into one thumbnail to expand the photo, I still see nothing; there are no humans in my living room, and Athena looks relatively at-ease.  That is until I come across a picture where her tail is sticking straight out/up, and she is posturing towards the back of the house (she usually barks at activity in the front).  I scroll through two more pictures and my heart stops: a person at my back door.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; height:    auto;" src='/images/burglary.jpg'></p>
<p>I never expected my Raspberry Pi's home surveillance program to actually capture criminal activity.  While it was certainly a part of the reason for developing it in the first place, I never thought it would actually happen.  At that time, I barely had the Pi up and running every day and cycled through various automation options, some of them never working.   We were mostly happy that we could check in on Athena and see what she is up to while we're away.</p>
